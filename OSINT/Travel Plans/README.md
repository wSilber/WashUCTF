# Travel Plans

## Challenge Description

I know better than to post my location on social media, so I crossed out the name of my hotel. No one will be able to figure out where I'm staying!

Flag is of format flag{hotel_name}

## Solution 

At first glance, we see some flags on top of the building, with the Swedish flag placed in the center and higher than the others. This tells us that the location is somewhere in Sweden

While the poster was careful to omit the hotel name from the image, he neglected to look at the building next door, which has a sign saying KAK. An image search for KAK Sweden gives several results, including [this one](https://c8.alamy.com/comp/C70Y7K/grand-hotel-on-the-waterfront-in-stockholm-sweden-C70Y7K.jpg), which shows the name of the hotel next door, Grand Hotel.

## Flag: flag{grand_hotel}
